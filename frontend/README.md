# Quantum Correctness by Construction On The Web - Frontend

## Requirements
On the web-based user interface, users create quantum programs
by drag-and-dropping refinements. The algorithm itself
is represented by a tree of boxes, where every box contains
the attributes of the corresponding refinement rule. That
includes pre-, post- or intermediate conditions, depending
on the rule, and quantum language statements, which are
entered by the user. Created algorithms should be exportable
to a file.

## Realization
HTML, SCSS, TS with Angular@17.0.2 framework.
