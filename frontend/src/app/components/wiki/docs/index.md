# WebCorC Ecosystem: What it is and why it matters
Functional correctness is a central aspect of every software system. Software development approaches based on test cases are a fast and reliable way to show that the tested parts of a software system function as intended. However, the main advantage of test case generation, partial guarantees, is also its biggest drawback. Comprehensive functional correctness guarantees are required in many software systems, and verification is used to ensure that.

Correctness-By-Construction (CbC) engineering introduced by [Kourie and Watson](#references) is based on [Design-by-Contract](#references), which connects contracts with programs. Using logical formulas, a program's contract formally specifies what it expects as input, the precondition, and which outputs it produces, the postcondition. Traditionally, once a program is implemented and specified, it is verified afterwards whether it fulfills its obligations according to its contract. This approach is called [post-hoc verification](#references). The main idea behind CbC is to guide developers in incrementally specifying and implementing a program. Stepwise specification and implementation enable the creation of correct programs by construction since each specification and implementation step can be verified through deductive verifiers. This is the key advantage of CbC compared to post-hoc verification. Implementing a program using CbC starts with an abstract hoare triple `{P}S{Q}` where symbols `P` and `Q` are the pre- and postcondition of the program, and symbol `S` represents the implementation abstractly. Given a set of *refinement rules*, we can *refine* the symbol `S` iteratively to concrete code. Each refinement rule has side conditions that we must specify.

We call WebCorC, including CorC and all provided features, the WebCorC ecosystem. The eclipse CbC development environment CorC currently contains a ton of features.
