## Information Flow
The CorC ecosystem supports the definition of information flow policies and provides an extension to create programs that comply to these policies by construction.

To use the information flow functionally, you can create new secure variables by adding `Variables` and `Variable` from the `Palette`, and using these variables in the program. For example, a private variable x can be introduced by writing private in the Confidentiality column.
