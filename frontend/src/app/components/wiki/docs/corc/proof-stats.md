## Proof Statistics
Statistics like execution time, proof status, number of branches, and more can be summarized and visualized with the proof statistic extension. To show proof statistics for a single CbC program: `Right-click the diagram -> View CorC Statistics`. Furthermore, CorC provides diagrams for the average execution time and the time per configuration in [SPLs](#software-product-lines) if multiple CbC programs are selected. These diagrams are shown at the bottom of the `Statistics Viewer`. Note that the diagrams are generated by [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Therefore, we must install and add it to the environment variable [PATH](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows) to view proof statistic diagrams.
