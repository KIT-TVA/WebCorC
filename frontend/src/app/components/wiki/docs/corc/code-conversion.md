## Code to CbC
Use the Code to CbC extension to generate a CbC program from plain Java code. The extension generates the corresponding diagram in the graphical editor. Following the creation of the diagram, we must provide missing conditions for the refinement rules. Use the extension by:
1. Select the Java source file.
2. Press the context menu option `Generate Diagrams from Class`.
3. Add additional conditions to the generated Java code using [JML](#references).
